Our Little Universe - static site (single-page)

Structure:
- index.html
- css/style.css
- js/main.js
- audio/wefellinloveinoctober.mp3

Notes:
- Audio file was copied from uploaded file. It's set to loop in the page.
- Google Drive images are used as external links; ensure they are public (Anyone with link can view).
- To deploy on Vercel: push this folder to a Git repo and link to Vercel (static site).
- To test locally: open index.html in a browser (some browsers require serving via simple http server for autoplay to work).

Enjoy â€” ping me if you want tweaks (text changes, more photos, animations).
